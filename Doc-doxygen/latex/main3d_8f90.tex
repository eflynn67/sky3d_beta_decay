{\footnotesize\ttfamily program tdhf3d}



This is the main program that organizes the reading of the input and funnels the calculation into the correct subroutines. 

It consists of a number of simple steps. They are\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item initialize {\ttfamily M\+PI} in case of an {\ttfamily M\+PI} parallel job. Start reading from standard input beginning with namelist files for any changes in the file names.
\item read the definition of the force to be used and set it up.
\item read namelist main, which contains the overall controlling parameters. The choice of {\ttfamily imode} is used to set up {\ttfamily tstatic} and {\ttfamily tdynamic} as logical variables. In addition, if this is a restart, the number of fragments is set to one. The properties of this one fragment are then filled in in subroutine {\ttfamily getin\+\_\+fragments}.
\item read the grid definition. With the dimensions known, all grid-\/based arrays (but not the wave functions) can be allocated and the initialization of the {\ttfamily F\+F\+TW} system can be done.
\item the appropriate namelist is read for the static or dynamic case, defining some parameters in those modules.
\item determine wave function numbers. The way this is done depends on the choice of {\ttfamily nof}. For positive {\ttfamily nof}, the fragment files are consulted to find out the properties of each and add up the numbers. For {\ttfamily nof=0} the numbers are taken from namelist {\ttfamily static}, which was read before. If {\ttfamily nof$<$0}, they are also given in namelist {\ttfamily static}, but the wave functions will be replaced by user-\/calculated ones.
\item now that the numbers are known, the wave function distribution over nodes is computed or set to trivial for a sequential calculation, and the the arrays related with wave functions are allocated.
\item the initial values of the wave functions are calculated. For {\ttfamily nof$>$0} the wave functions are read from the fragment files and inserted into the proper positions. For {\ttfamily nof=0} the routine {\ttfamily harmosc} in module {\ttfamily Static} is called to calculate harmonic-\/oscillator wave function, and for {\ttfamily nof$<$0} the routine {\ttfamily init\+\_\+user} does an arbitrary user initialization.
\item the mean-\/field arrays are zeroed and the Coulomb solver is initialized.
\item the calculation branches into either static or dynamic mode.

In the static calculation, {\ttfamily init\+\_\+static} just prints some information and sets up damping and {\ttfamily statichf} does the real calculation.

In the dynamic case, the subroutine {\ttfamily dynamichf} does all the work.
\item finally the {\ttfamily M\+PI} system is terminated.
