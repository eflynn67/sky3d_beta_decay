\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
This module calculates all the ingredients needed for the energy functional and for applying the single-\/particle Hamiltonian to a wave function. 

The work is done by two subroutines\+: {\ttfamily skyrme} for the calculation of all the fields, which can be scalar or vector and isospin-\/dependent. {\ttfamily hpsi} then is the routine applying the single-\/particle Hamiltonian to one single-\/particle wave function.

Note the division of labor between {\ttfamily skyrme} and {\ttfamily add\+\_\+density} of module {\ttfamily Densities\+:} everything that constructs fields -\/ densities and current densities -\/ from the single-\/particle wave functions is done in {\ttfamily add\+\_\+density}, which is called in a loop over the states, while {\ttfamily skyrme} does the further manipulations to complete the fields entering the single-\/particle Hamiltonian by combining the densities and their derivatives. It does not need access to the wave functions.

This subroutine has the simple task of allocating all the fields that are local to the module {\ttfamily Meanfield}. 

\mbox{\Hypertarget{namespacemeanfield_aad360aa7a912c2b6ffcb71715bd026eb}\label{namespacemeanfield_aad360aa7a912c2b6ffcb71715bd026eb}}

{\footnotesize\ttfamily subroutine meanfield\+::hpsi (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{integer, intent(in)}]{iq,  }\item[{real(db), intent(in)}]{eshift,  }\item[{complex(db), dimension(\+:,\+:,\+:,\+:), intent(inout)}]{pinn,  }\item[{complex(db), dimension(\+:,\+:,\+:,\+:), intent(out)}]{pout }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



This subroutine applies the single-\/particle Hamiltonian to a single-\/particle wave function {\ttfamily pinn} to produce an output wave function {\ttfamily pout}. The argument {\ttfamily iq} indicates the isospin for the wave function and {\ttfamily eshift} is an energy shift which is zero in the dynamic calculation but crucial to the static algorithm (see {\ttfamily grstep} in module {\ttfamily Static}). 

For an understanding of this module the role of the following local variables is crucial. They are
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily is\+:} this is used in the loops over spin to indicate the spin component\+: {\ttfamily  is=1 } for spin up and {\ttfamily  is=2 } for spin down.
\item {\ttfamily ic\+:} denotes the index for the opposite spin; it is calculated as {\ttfamily  ic=3-\/is }. Note the similar handling of the two isospin projections using {\ttfamily iq} and {\ttfamily icomp} in subroutine {\ttfamily skyrme}.
\item {\ttfamily sigis\+:} this variable denotes the sign of the spin projection. It is calculated as {\ttfamily  sigis=3-\/2$\ast$is } and thus is {\ttfamily +1} for spin up ({\ttfamily  is=1 }) and {\ttfamily -\/} for spin down ({\ttfamily  is=2 }).
\end{DoxyItemize}

The general structure of the subroutine is as follows\+: first the part of the Hamiltonian not involving derivatives is applied, followed by the terms involving derivatives in order $ x $, $ y $, \$z\$. Since the structure of the Hamiltonian involves only first or second derivatives in one spatial direction in each term, the derivatives can be calculated for one direction and then the working space can be reused for the next one.

The expressions for the different spatial derivatives are quite analogous, so that only the \$x\$-\/direction will be discussed at length below.

The expressions is repeated here\+: \[ \hat h=U_q(\vec r)-\nabla\cdot\left[B_q(\vec r)\nabla\right] +\I\vec W_q\cdot(\vec\sigma\times\nabla) +\vec S_q\cdot\vec\sigma -\frac{\I}{2} \left[(\nabla\cdot\vec A_q)+2\vec A_q\cdot\nabla\right]. \]


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item the non-\/derivative parts not involving spin. These arise from $ U_q $ and $ -\tfrac{\I}{2}\,\nabla\cdot\vec A_q $, which are combined into a complex expression. The energy shift {\ttfamily eshift} is also included.
\item the spin current coupling is constructed by simply using the explicit definition of the Pauli matrices and multiplying the resulting matrix onto the spinor wave function.
\item the first and second derivative in the $ x $-\/direction are evaluated and stored in the arrays {\ttfamily pswk} and {\ttfamily pswk2}. The last term in the Hamiltonian gives rise to the two contributions \[ -\frac{\partial B_q}{\partial x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}-B_q \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}, \] of which the second is evaluated straightforwardly, while the first one is combined with the spin-\/orbit contribution. The part of $ \I\vec W_q\cdot(\vec\sigma\times\nabla) $ that contains an $ x $-\/derivative is \[ (\I W_y\sigma_z-\I W_z\sigma_y)\frac{\partial}{\partial x}= \begin{pmatrix} \I W_y&-W_z\\ W_z&-\I W_y \end{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \] This is programmed employing the variable {\ttfamily sigis} to account for the different signs in the rows of the matrix.
\item for the derivatives in the \$y\$-\/direction the procedure is similar; the spin-\/orbit part is now \[ (\I W_z\sigma_x-\I W_x\sigma_z)\frac{\partial}{\partial y}= \begin{pmatrix} -\I W_x&\I W_z\\ \I W_z&\I W_x \end{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \]
\item for the derivatives in the $ z $-\/direction the procedure is again similar; the spin-\/orbit part is now \[ (\I W_x\sigma_y-\I W_y\sigma_x)\frac{\partial}{\partial z}= \begin{pmatrix} 0&W_x-\I W_y\\ -W_x-\I W_y & 0 \end{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \]

In this subroutine the various fields are calculated from the densities that were previously generated in module {\ttfamily Densities}. 

The expressions divide up the contributions into an isospin-\/summed part with $ b $-\/coefficients followed by the isospin-\/dependent one with $ b\textnormal{\textquotesingle} $-\/coefficients. As it would be a waste of space to store the summed densities and currents, the expressions are divided up more conveniently. If we denote the isospin index $ q $ by {\ttfamily iq} and the index for the opposite isospin $ q\textnormal{\textquotesingle} $ by {\ttfamily ic} (as {\ttfamily iq} can take the values 1 or 2, it can conveniently be calculated as {\ttfamily  3-\/iq }), this can be written for example as

$ b_1\rho-b_1\textnormal{\textquotesingle}\rho_q\longrightarrow b_1(\rho_q+\rho_{q\textnormal{\textquotesingle}})-b_1\textnormal{\textquotesingle}\rho_q $ $ \longrightarrow $ {\ttfamily (b1-\/b1p)$\ast$rho(\+:,\+:,\+:,iq)+b1$\ast$rho(\+:,\+:,\+:,ic)} This decomposition is used in all applicable cases.

For intermediate results the fields {\ttfamily workden} (scalar) and {\ttfamily workvec} (vector) are used.

Now the subroutine proceeds in the following steps\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item all the parts in {\ttfamily upot} involving an $ \alpha $-\/dependent power of the density are collected. Note that in order to avoid having to calculate different powers, $ \rho^\alpha $ is factored out. The division by the total density uses the small number {\ttfamily epsilon} to avoid division by zero.
\item the divergence of $ \vec J $ ({\ttfamily sodens}) is calculated for both isospins in {\ttfamily workden} and the contributions are added to {\ttfamily upot}.
\item the Coulomb potential is calculated using subroutine {\ttfamily poisson} (see module {\ttfamily Coulomb}). It and the Slater exchange correction (only if the {\ttfamily ex} parameter in the force is nonzero) are added to {\ttfamily upot} for protons, {\ttfamily  iq=2 }.
\item the Laplacian is applied to the densities and the result stored in {\ttfamily workden}. Then the remaining terms are constructed. ~\newline
 Note that the {\ttfamily iq} -\/loop is combined with the following steps.
\item the effective mass is calculated.
\item the gradient of the density is calculated and the spin-\/orbit vector $ \vec W_q $ is constructed in {\ttfamily wlspot}.
\item the curl of the spin density vector is calculated and stored in {\ttfamily workvec}.
\item the vector $ \vec A_q $ is calculated from the current density and the curl of the spin density.
\item the curl of the current density is calculated and stored in {\ttfamily spot}.
\item now the two isospin contributions in {\ttfamily spot} are combined in the proper way. This way of handling it avoids the introduction of an additional work vector for $ \nabla\times\vec\jmath_q $.
\item the divergence of $ \vec A_q $ is calculated and stored in {\ttfamily divaq}.
\item finally, the gradient of the effective mass term $ B_q $ is calculated and stored in the vector variable {\ttfamily dbmass}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

This concludes the calculation of all scalar and vector fields needed for the application of the Skyrme force.
