The nuclear mean-\/field model based on Skyrme forces or related density functionals has found widespread application to the description of nuclear ground states, collective vibrational excitations, and heavy-\/ion collisions. The code Sky3D solves the static or dynamic equations on a three-\/dimensional Cartesian mesh with isolated or periodic boundary conditions and no further symmetry assumptions. Pairing can be included in the B\+CS approximation for the static case. The code is implemented with a view to allow easy modifications for including additional physics or special analysis of the results. \begin{DoxyAuthor}{Author}
